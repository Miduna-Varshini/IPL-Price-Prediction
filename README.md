IPL Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the IPL player price based on player performance and statistics using a Machine Learning model.
The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm and deployed using Streamlit for a simple web interface.

🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning application that:

Takes player performance details as input

Predicts the estimated IPL auction price

Demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow (training → saving model → deployment)

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

Random Forest Regressor

Chosen for its:

High accuracy

Ability to handle non-linear data

Reduced overfitting compared to single decision trees
