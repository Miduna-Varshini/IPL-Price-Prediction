IPL Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the IPL player auction price using a Machine Learning model based on player performance and statistics. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm, which helps in making accurate predictions by learning patterns from historical data.

The trained model is saved as a pickle (.pkl) file and deployed using Streamlit to create a simple and interactive web application. This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including model training, saving, and deployment, and is mainly developed for learning and educational purposes.
